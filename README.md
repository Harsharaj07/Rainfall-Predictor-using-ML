A Rainfall Prediction Web App is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the likelihood or amount of rainfall based on weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed.

The app uses Streamlit, a Python library, to provide an easy-to-use web interface where users can input weather data and get real-time predictions.

🔍 Core Components:
Machine Learning Model

Trained on historical weather data.

Predicts rainfall based on input features.

Streamlit Frontend

User-friendly form to input values (temperature, humidity, etc.).

Displays the prediction result instantly.

Backend (Python & ML)

Preprocessing input data.

Using a trained ML model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) to make predictions.

⚙️ Technologies Used:
Python

Streamlit (for Web UI)

Scikit-learn / TensorFlow (for ML model)

Pandas, NumPy (for data handling)

✅ Features:
Simple Web Interface.

Real-time rainfall prediction.

Easy to run locally or deploy online (like on Streamlit Cloud).
